# Olist E-commerce Analysis Using SQL and PowerBI

## Overview

This project delves into the comprehensive dataset provided by Olist, a leading Brazilian e-commerce platform. By analyzing customer orders, product details, seller performance, reviews, geolocation, and sales metrics, we extract valuable insights into **customer behavior, product performance, and overall business trends** in the e-commerce industry. This analysis is aimed at supporting data-driven decision-making for enhanced business strategies.

## Objectives

### 1. Database Design and Data Import

The first phase involves designing and structuring the database in PostgreSQL to establish relationships among the datasets. The key tasks include

  - Creating all tables in a structured order to maintain relational integrity.
  - Selecting appropriate data types for optimized storage and performance.
  - Establishing Primary Keys and Foreign Keys to define relationships between tables.
  - Importing data in a structured sequence to maintain referential integrity.
  - Developing an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize table relationships

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL

After successful data ingestion, SQL queries are used to conduct in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), uncovering key business insights. The major analyses include:
  - Customer and Seller Analysis
  - Delivery and Review Analysis
  - Sales and Revenue Analysis

### 3. Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI Dashboard aims to provide an interactive and visually compelling analysis of the Olist e-commerce dataset, enabling data-driven decision-making.
